# Claude Code DevContainers

Pre-configured development containers optimized for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), enabling AI-assisted development across various programming languages and environments.

## Features

- üß† **Claude Code Integration**: Pre-configured with Claude Code extension
- üì¶ **Language-specific configurations**: Tailored environments for different development needs
- üîß **Development tools**: Git, VS Code extensions, and language-specific tooling
- üê≥ **Optional Docker support**: DOOD capability available for environments that need it

## Available Environments

### Basic (No Docker Required)
- **Node.js/JavaScript** (`basic/base/`) - Node.js development environment with Claude Code integration
- **TLA+** (`basic/tlaplus/`) - Formal specification language with TLC model checker

### Docker-Required (DOOD)
- **Node.js/JavaScript** (`docker-required/dood/base/`) - Node.js development with Docker access
- **Rust** (`docker-required/dood/rust/`) - Rust development with Cargo and Docker access

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saitotm/claude-code-devcontainers.git
   cd claude-code-devcontainers
   ```

2. Choose your development environment based on your needs:

   - **Basic**: Use configurations from `basic/` for environments that don't require Docker
   - **Docker-required**: Use configurations from `docker-required/` if you need Docker access

3. Copy the desired `.devcontainer` folder to your project root:

   ```bash
   # Example for TLA+ projects (no Docker required)
   cp -r basic/tlaplus/.devcontainer /path/to/your/project/
   
   # Example for Node.js projects with Docker support
   cp -r docker-required/dood/base/.devcontainer /path/to/your/project/
   ```

4. Open your project in VS Code and select "Reopen in Container"

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine
- VS Code with Dev Containers extension
